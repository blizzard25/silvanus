# Silvanus Project

Silvanus is a cryptocurrency focusing on greenchain solutions. Instead of using energy heavy proof-of-work (PoW) mining methods, it relies on proof-of-green (PoG) to mint new tokens. Proof of green occurs when actions are taken that reduce carbon footprint, such as solar charging behavior or EV regenerative braking.
